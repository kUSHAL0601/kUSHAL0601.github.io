Kushal does a 9-5 job like any other Software Engineer. He works for a so called _"tech giant"_. But he keeps on working on a lot of new stuff over the weekends, be it open source or research or randomest apps ever! He can get quite lazy too, doesn't miss out on good food on weekends, but def. tries to explore as much as the field has to offer.

__P.S. He is always open to collabarations if it seems interesting to him!__
