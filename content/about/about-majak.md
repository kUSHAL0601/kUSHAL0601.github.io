MajAK is something that Kushal has given to himself. His Names is actually Kushal A Majmundar, hence dumbly enough MajAK. _MajAK_ in his mother tounge _Gujarati_ means **_Kidding_** in some sorts, but it is hard to understand Kushal's sense of humour. It is __Broken__. But now since MajAK is stuck to his brain, he tends to carry it everywhere, from acads, to corp, to accounts and in gaming to! Kushal gets funny only if your sense of humour is broken to :|

__P.S. He loves emoticons!__
