Kushal is a tech enthusiast, who is a graduate from International Institute of Information technology, Hyderabad! He hails from this small town of Vadodara. He thinks he is good at Mathemetics but is really bad. Apart from nerdy stuff, he loves basketball (is a big __Kyrie__ fan), carelessly likes to spend his money on shoes and has developed a taste for watching competitive CSGO (__NiP__ fan in the house). He gets as childish as one can get when it comes to __NERF__ and the randomest toys ever, but is mature when it comes to life Ig :)

__P.S. He likes using PostScripts everywhere!__
